# Hubitat Integration for Home Assistant

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-orange.svg)](https://github.com/hacs/integration)

This integration uses [Hubitat’s](hubitat.com)
[Maker API](https://docs.hubitat.com/index.php?title=Hubitat™_Maker_API) to
make Hubitat devices available for use with Home Assistant.

## Quick Start

1. Create a Maker API instance in Hubitat
2. Add the devices you want to share in Maker API
3. Install HACS
4. Add the Hubitat integration in HACS
5. Add an instance of the Hubitat integration in Home Assistant's Integrations
   page

> ⚠️ If you notice that devices aren't updating in Home Assistant, see the
> [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section below.

## Installation

This component is an _integration_, which is different from an _add on_.
Integrations are managed through the “Devices & Services” configuration menu
rather than through “Add-ons, Backups & Supervisor”.

There are two methods for installing this integration. One is to use HACS, a
tool is used to install and update third party integrations (such as this one).
The second option is to install this integration manually by cloning the
repository and copying the integration files to the proper location in your HA
config directory.

Note that you will need to restart Home Assistant after installation, whichever
method is used.

### HACS

First, [install HACS](https://hacs.xyz/docs/setup/prerequisites) if you haven't
already.

Once HACS has been installed and shows up in the sidebar, open it and go to
Integrations, and then click the orange '+' button in the lower right corner to
add an integration. Search for “Hubitat” and install it.

### Manually

Clone this repository and copy the `custom_components/hubitat` folder into your
`<config>/custom_components/` directory (so you end up with
`<config>/custom_components/hubitat`).

## Setup

The basic setup process is:

1. Create a Maker API instance in Hubitat
2. Add the devices you want to use in HA to the Maker API instance
3. Setup the integration in HA

First, create a Maker API instance in the Hubitat UI. Add whatever devices you’d
like to make available to Home Assistant. If you plan to use the integration
over SSL, you‘ll probably want to enable the “Ignore SSL Certificates” toggle.

To configure the Hubitat integration, go to Configuration -> Integrations in the
Home Assistant UI and click the “+” button to add a new integration. Pick
“Hubitat”, then provide:

- The address of the hub (e.g., `http://10.0.1.99` or just `10.0.1.99` if you’re
  not using https)
- The app ID of the Maker API instance (the 2, 3 or 4 digit number after
  `/apps/api/` in any of the Maker API URLs)
- The API access token
- Optional: An address for the event server to listen on (more about this
  below); this will be chosen automatically by default
- Optional: A port for the event server to listen on (more about this below);
  this will be chosen automatically by default
- Optional: Provide the relative paths to an SSL private key and certificate
  (e.g., `ssl/localhost-key.pem` and `ssl/localhost.pem`). These are files that
  you will need to generate using a tool such as `mkcert` or `openssl` If these
  paths are provided, the event server (described below) will serve over SSL
  (and _only_ over SSL).

### Event server

Hubitat’s official way to push events to receivers is via HTTP POST requests.
Every time a device event occurs, the Maker API will make an HTTP POST request
to the address set in its “URL to send device events to by POST” setting.

To receive these events, the integration starts up a Python-based web server and
updates the POST URL setting in the Maker API instance. Note that for this to
work, Hubitat must be able to see your Home Assistant server on your local
network.

> ⚠️ Note that the event server URL, if specified, should only include a
> protocol and a host, _not_ a path. The server always listens at `/`.

### Device types

The integration assigns Home Assistant device classes based on the capabilities
reported by Hubitat. Sometimes the device type is ambiguous; a switchable outlet
and a light switch may both only implement Hubitat’s
[Switch](https://docs.hubitat.com/index.php?title=Driver_Capability_List#Switch)
capability, and will therefore look like the same type of device to the
integration. In some of these cases, the integration guesses the device class
based on the device’s label (e.g., a switch named “Office Lamp” would be setup
as a light in Home Assistant). This heuristic behavior is currently only used
for lights and switches.

### Adding new devices

After adding new devices to the Maker API instance in Hubitat, **you will not be
able to control them through Home Assistant until the you reload the device list
in the integration.** There are two ways to reload the device list:

1. Restart Home Assistant
2. Open the Hubitat integration settings in Home Assistant and go through the
   config flow. During this process the integration will reload the device list
   from Hubitat.

Once the integration has loaded the new device list, any new devices added to
the Maker API instance should show up in Home Assistant.

## Services

This integration adds several service calls to Home Assistant.

- Delete the alarm code at a given position in a lock or keypad
  ```yaml
  service: hubitat.clear_code
  data:
    entity_id: lock.some_lock
    position: 1
  ```
- Set a user code for a lock or keypad
  ```yaml
  service: hubitat.set_code
  data:
    entity_id: lock.some_lock
    position: 1
    code: 5213
    name: Guests
  ```
- Set the length of user codes for a lock or keypad
  ```yaml
  service: hubitat.set_code_length
  data:
    entity_id: lock.some_lock
    length: 4
  ```
- Get the user codes for a lock or keypad
  ```yaml
  service: hubitat.get_codes
  data:
    entity_id: lock.some_lock
  response_variable: codes
  ```
- Set the entry delay for a security keypad in seconds
  ```yaml
  service: hubitat.set_entry_delay
  data:
    entity_id: alarm_control_panel.some_alarm
    delay: 30
  ```
- Set the exit delay for a security keypad in seconds
  ```yaml
  service: hubitat.set_exit_delay
  data:
    entity_id: alarm_control_panel.some_alarm
    delay: 30
  ```
- Send a command to a Hubitat device
  ```yaml
  service: hubitat.send_command
  data:
    entity_id: switch.some_switch
    command: on
  ```
  ```yaml
  service: hubitat.send_command
  data:
    entity_id: light.some_light
    command: setHue
    args: 75
  ```
  ```yaml
  service: hubitat.send_command
  data:
    entity_id: light.some_light
    command: setLevel
    args: [50, 3]
  ```

## Event-emitting devices

Some devices, such as pushable buttons, emit events rather than having state.
Other devices such as locks both emit events and have state. Devices that _only_
contain event emitters and have no stateful components won’t have any associated
entities in Home Assistant.

Event emitting devices can be used as triggers in Home Assistant automations, or
in Node Red. In Home Assistant, you can use event emitters as “Device” triggers.
Whenever a device emits an event, such as a button press, the automation will be
triggered. In Node Red, a workflow can listen for `hubitat_event` events and
filter them based on properties in `payload.event`.

## Updating

The update process depends on how the integration was installed. If it was
installed with HACS, open the integration in HACS and click the “Upgrade” link.
The process for manually updating is the same as for manual installation.

Note that you will need to restart Home Assistant after updating, whichever
method is used.

## Troubleshooting

### Devices aren't updating

If the integration was set up successfully but devices aren't updating, the
problem is almost always that Hubitat is unable to send messages to Home
Assistant. Just because HA can talk to Hubitat does _not_ mean that Hubitat can
talk back to HA. This usually happens when Home Assistant is running in a VM or
Docker container that hasn't been bridged to the local network. In this
situation, the URL that the integration tells Maker API to send device events to
will be an address on the virtualization system's internal network, which
Hubitat won't be able to address.

There are two solutions. One is to update the container or VM to use network
bridging, so that the virtual system appears like a host on the local network.
In this situation, HA's network address will be directly visible to Hubitat, so
the integration will be able to set things up automatically.

The second solution is to manually set the event server URL and port values in
the integration to something that Hubitat _can_ see. The event server URL should
point to the host that's running your Home Assistant VM or container. For
example, if the host running the HA instance is on the local network at
192.168.0.10, then the event server URL would be set to http://192.168.0.10. The
port should be set to some open port value (e.g., 12345), and then this port
must be mapped from the host to the HA VM/container.

> ⚠️ Note that the event server URL should only include a protocol and a host,
> _not_ a path. The server always listens at `/`.

### Checking device capabilities

If a device isn't showing up in Home Assistant in the way you expect (like, a
fan is showing up as a light), the problem may be that this integration is
having trouble telling what kind of device it is. The integration uses
"capability" information from the Maker API to determine what type of device a
given device is.

You can display the capabilities for a particular device, along with other
information, by making a request to the Maker API:

```
$ curl 'http://HUBITAT_ADDRESS/apps/api/MAKER_API_ID/devices/DEVICE_ID?access_token=TOKEN&prettyPrint=true
```

If you open your Maker API instance in Hubitat, example URLs are shown at the
bottom of the page. You can query these URLs using a command like command like
`curl`, as show above, or in a browser. You should see output like:

### Logging

If you run into problems, one of the first steps to take is to enable debug
logging for the Hubitat integration. This will provide more insight into what
the integration is doing, and may help track down problems. To enable debug
logging:

1. Open your Home Assistant `configuration.yaml` file in an editor
2. Add the following content. If you already have a `logger` section, add the
   `hubitatmaker` and `custom_components.hubitat` lines to it.
   ```yaml
   logger:
     default: info
     logs:
       hubitatmaker: debug
       custom_components.hubitat: debug
   ```
3. Restart Home Assistant

If you open Home Assistant's log file (`config/home-assistant.log`) after HA
restarts, you should see quite a few messages related to Hubitat (mixed in with
messages for other components), like:

```

### HSM status or modes not updating

Ensure that the “POST location events?” toggle is enabled in your Maker API app
in Hubitat.
